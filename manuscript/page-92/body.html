Yet, if thou swear’st,<br>Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,<br>They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<br>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.<br>Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,<br>I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,<br>So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.<br>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;<br>And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:<br>But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true<br>Than those that have more cunning to be strange.<br>I should have been more strange, I must confess,<br>But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,<br>My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,<br>And not impute this yielding to light love,<br>Which the dark night hath so discovered.</p></div> </div>
