So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows<br>As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.<br>The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,<br>And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.<br>Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!  
For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.</p><p>TYBALT.<br>This by his voice, should be a Montague.<br>Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave<br>Come hither, cover’d with an antic face,<br>To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?<br>Now by the stock and honour of my kin,<br>To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.</p><p>CAPULET.<br>Why how now, kinsman!  
Wherefore storm you so?</p></div> </div>
