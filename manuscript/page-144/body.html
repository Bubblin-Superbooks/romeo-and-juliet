Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both your houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.</p><p>ROMEO.<br>I thought all for the best.</p><p>MERCUTIO.<br>Help me into some house, Benvolio,<br>Or I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.<br>They have made worms’ meat of me.<br>I have it, and soundly too. Your houses!</p></div> </div>
