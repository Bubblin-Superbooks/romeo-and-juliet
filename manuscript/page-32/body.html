<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>BENVOLIO.<br>Alas that love so gentle in his view,<br>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.</p><p>ROMEO.<br>Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,<br>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!  
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?<br>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.<br>Hereâ€™s much to do with hate, but more with love:<br>Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!  
O anything, of nothing first create!  
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!  
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!  
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!  
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!  
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.<br>Dost thou not laugh?</p><p>BENVOLIO.<br>No coz, I rather weep.</p></div> </div>
