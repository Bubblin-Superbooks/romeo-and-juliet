The sweetest honey<br>Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,<br>And in the taste confounds the appetite.<br>Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;<br>Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.</p><p>Enter Juliet.</p><p>Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot<br>Will neâ€™er wear out the everlasting flint.<br>A lover may bestride the gossamers<br>That idles in the wanton summer air<br>And yet not fall; so light is vanity.</p><p>JULIET.<br>Good even to my ghostly confessor.</p><p>FRIAR LAWRENCE.<br>Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.</p></div> </div>
